## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to guide me in the right direction to help me understand key concepts and wet my feet for the start of class, I built this for the sole purpose of having a cheat sheet that way I can always have something to go back to if I don't understand something, it is my belief that to improve in a skill is to master the basics, this didn't solve a problem for me yet but it will solve many in the future. I learned a little bit of different coding languages and what their importance were
